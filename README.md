This is a Shell for Linux operating Systems with limited features written using [POSIX C](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9376837/difference-bewteen-c-standard-library-and-c-posix-library#answer-9377007)

It's features include :-
1)Pipes
2)Builtin commands
3)parsing a command
commands must be only in a single line and builtins include --'cd', 'help' ,'ls','exit'
 and I love to increase its feature's set
